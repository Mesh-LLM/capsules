// What one Exchanges row shows about the other side: its state, the record of
// theirs the badge, the checks panel and Compare all use, and the lines about
// asking. Every source is weighed here, by these rules and nothing else:
//
//   1. Candidates. Records: the live fetch this browser ran, the record the
//      pane correlated from a push, and the record an ask returned (the
//      latest one, or the last verified one when a later ask returned none).
//      Claims:
//      the pane's own outcome (their signed refusal or "no record", or the
//      door's refusal of a pushed record that named another server or model)
//      and an ask's verified refusal or "no record".
//   2. A record sets a verdict only when it is VERIFIED: its contents produce
//      its id and its signature holds under the key this node has for them
//      (`isVerifiedRecord`). The one exception: a record whose contents
//      demonstrably don't produce the id it claims (a completed check,
//      idMatch === false) is Disagree -- the other side handed over an
//      altered record, the "both present, disagreeing" case of the ratified
//      bilateral-retention-decay-property (agent-action-capsule @7f8a78d8);
//      a pushed one from a node that didn't serve the exchange excepted. A
//      bad signature over a matching id, or an id check that couldn't run,
//      is no verdict (`recordVerdict`).
//   3. Among verified records (and the door's refusal), any Disagree wins,
//      and that record is the one shown; otherwise any Confirmed wins.
//      Disagree beats Confirmed whatever the source, so a confirming record
//      can never hide a contradicting one.
//   4. With no verdict, the newest verified claim stands: the pane's or the
//      ask's, compared by the claim's signed time when both carry a full
//      RFC 3339 time; otherwise the pane's wins over the ask's.
//   5. The latest ask is always visible. When it isn't what the row shows, a
//      line says what it returned ("Asked again {time}: …").
//   6. A note never says "verified" for something the badge doesn't show: a
//      verified record that reaches no verdict says what it is instead.
//   7. With no verdict and no claim: "asked" once an ask was sent, else the
//      pane's own state (not held / not given / not asked).
//
// The record shown (`evidence`) is the verdict's record, else the first record
// held in the order above, so the checks panel always compares the record the
// row is talking about.
