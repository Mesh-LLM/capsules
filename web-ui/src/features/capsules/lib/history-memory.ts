// The last verified "Ask for their history" result per peer, kept in this
// browser so a reload still shows it, with when it was checked. Only a
// verified result is kept: a failure or a refusal says nothing worth carrying
// over. This is a per-viewer convenience, not a record: the node holds no
// copy, every read and write is wrapped (storage can be blocked or absent),
// and the page works the same without it.
//
// Each entry keeps its witness standing. An entry stored before the standing
// was kept has none, and is restored as `not_recorded`: never as witnessed,
// and never as checked against no witness, since neither was recorded.
