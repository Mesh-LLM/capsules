// "Ask for their history": ask the other side of an exchange for its history
// card (`history_card/1`), the list of its log's checkpoints with the proof
// that each extends the one before. The plugin sends the request and checks
// the reply under the key announced for that node (`evidenceRequestClient.ts`,
// `evidence_answer::verify_response`); this module judges what came back the
// same way `ask-for-record.ts` judges a record ask:
//
//   - an artifact counts only when the plugin verified it: every checkpoint
//     signed with their announced key, each extending the one before;
//   - a refusal counts only when it is signed with their announced key over
//     OUR request, checked again here in the browser;
//   - anything else (no announced key, a reply that proves nothing, no reply)
//     is a failed ask, and says why.
