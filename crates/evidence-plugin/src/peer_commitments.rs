//! The commitments this node holds for its peers (loop step 7, Ask,
//! acceptance item 4): the last one `mesh_commitment_fetch` fetched from
//! each peer that passed every check, so an ask can be judged against what
//! the peer advertised. A refusal carries no policy digest; what is checked
//! is the refusal against the policy the peer's commitment pins (Sherlock2,
//! Mesh-LLM/capsules-plugin#56).
//!
//! **Where.** `<data_dir>/`[`DIR`]`/<peer id>.json`, the frame as fetched
//! (`commitment::Signed::to_wire`). A later passing fetch replaces it. It is
//! never served.
//!
//! **What an ask records** ([`pinned`]): the digest of the held commitment
//! (SHA-256 of its JCS), the policy digest it pins and that policy's body,
//! in the `evidence_request` record (`crate::ask_book`), so a later fetch
//! never changes what the ask is judged against.
//!
//! **The check** ([`policy_check`]) on a signed refusal:
//! - `NOT_CHECKED` when no commitment was held at ask time;
//! - `MATCH` when the pinned policy allows the refusal: its reason blames
//!   the request, or the commitment does not answer the subject form;
//! - `MISMATCH` when the policy answers it to a stranger (`stranger_safe`)
//!   and the refusal withholds it (`derivation_unsupported`,
//!   `no_such_subject`);
//! - `MATCH` for a policy refusal under `evidence-interop/1` of record bodies
//!   the policy gives no one (`range` and `full_history`, or any record-body
//!   subject while `share_history_segments` is `off`);
//! - `NOT_CHECKED` otherwise: a `policy_declined` or `not_authorized`, which
//!   honest responders also send for load, size and signature limits, or an
//!   answer that depends on who asks, which the policy alone does not
//!   settle.
